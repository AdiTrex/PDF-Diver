This project focuses on analyzing census data using SQL to gain insights into various aspects of the population. The project leverages SQL's querying capabilities 
to explore the data, uncover patterns, and derive meaningful conclusions.


Project Overview

The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on census data using SQL. By querying the database, we aim to uncover valuable insights related to 
population demographics, economic characteristics, geospatial patterns, education, and more. The project involves writing SQL queries to extract relevant information 
and then analyzing the results to draw meaningful conclusions.

Installation

-> Clone the project repository to your local machine.
-> Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
-> Create a new database and import the census data provided (see the Data section for details).

Usage

-> Connect to your SQL database using a suitable client or command-line interface.
-> Execute the SQL queries provided in the Queries section to analyze the census data.
-> Review the results obtained from the queries to gain insights into the population characteristics.
-> Modify or create new queries as per your specific analysis requirements.
-> Document your findings and conclusions based on the results obtained.
